USER VARIABLES:
In order to customize the behaviour of the module you can set the following variables:
$dashboard_install  (default: "package") - Defines how you want to install dashboard, from package or cloning the git source ("package" or "source")
$dashboard_db  (default: sqlite) - Define DB backend ("sqlite", "postgresql" or "mysql")
$dashboard_db_server  (default: localhost) - Define DB server host (used if $dashboard_db = "mysql" or "postgresql")
$dashboard_db_user  (default: root) - Define DB access user (used if $dashboard_db = "mysql" or "postgresql")
$dashboard_db_password  (default: undefined) - Define DB access password (used if $dashboard_db = "mysql" or "postgresql")


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include dashboard              # Install and run dashboard with standard configurations.
include dashboard::disable     # Disable dashboard service.
include dashboard::disableboot # Disable dashboard service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include dashboard::absent      # Remove dashboard package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include dashboard::monitor     # Monitor dashboard  Automatically included if $monitor=yes

Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)

Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
